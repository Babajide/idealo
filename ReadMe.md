# Project Notes.
### Author: Prince Agbebiyi

Thank you for the opportunity. I have coded the backend/service layer in accordance to the unit test, -TDD

What could be improved:
* Exception handling
* More domain Object
* Ability to remove and update cart
* Data layer to fetch rules from DB
* Expose the service as a HTTP Rest service

The above were not added as it was not clear if it is part of the assessment.

# Testing the application
`mvn test`
